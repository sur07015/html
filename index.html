                    <p>Topic modeling is an unsupervised technique based statistical modeling used to unveil the core “topics” from a large volume of textual documents. Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), proposed by J. K. Pritchard, M. Stephens and P. Donnelly  is such a topic model that generates topics based on word frequency from set of given documents. It is based upon two assumptions: First, documents with similar words belong to the same topic. Second, documents with groups of words together appear in different documents belongs to the same topic.</p>

                    <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

                    <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

                    <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
